## Set-up front environemnt

I've created a simple front using Angular. Because the application is hosted on Angular side, you need to have Node.js and Angular Cli installed. 
1. Install Node.js server: You can download and install Node.js server using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/. Toghether with Node.js is installed the npm client command line interface.
2. Install Angular CLI: from command line run: npm install -g @angular/cli

## Install front

Front can be downloaded from github using this link: **https://github.com/iuliaiancu/banking_front.git**

1. Install Angular dependencies: go to where you downloaded folder, open a command prompt and type: **npm install**.
2. Start the Node.js server: **ng serve --watch --open**. By default it will launch the server listening on port 4200. This should open a browser window: http://localhost:4200
